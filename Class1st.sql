1. What is DBMS? (Database Management System)

A DBMS is a software system used to store, manage, update, retrieve, and secure data in an organized manner.

🔹 Why DBMS is Needed?

Before DBMS, we used file systems, which had many problems:

Data duplication

No security

No recovery

Data inconsistency

Slow access

DBMS solves all these problems.

🔹 Examples of DBMS:

MySQL

Oracle

SQLite

MongoDB

SQL Server

🔹 Advantages of DBMS:

Data Security

Data Sharing

Backup & Recovery

Reduced Redundancy

Fast Access

Data Integrity
